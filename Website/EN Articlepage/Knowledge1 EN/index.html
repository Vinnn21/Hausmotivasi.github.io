      <p>Seeking knowledge in Islam is an obligation for every Muslim, as stated in the hadith of the Prophet. "Seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim." This means that seeking knowledge is obligatory for every Muslim and must be equated with other obligations such as prayer, Hajj, fasting, as it is an individual obligation (fard 'ain).</p>
      <p>Because how can someone pray, fast, perform Hajj correctly if they do not have knowledge about these matters? Thus, seeking knowledge precedes actions. Hence, scholars say one must have knowledge before engaging in deeds or performing worship and speaking. In the Quran, Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala also says: "And do not follow that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight, and the heart - about all those [one] will be questioned."</p>    
      <p>Thus, Islam is a religion full of motivation. One of the motivations for knowledge is that among the special qualities of a knowledgeable person is that Allah will elevate their status, as stated in Surah Al-Mujadilah, verse 11. "And when it is said to them, 'Come, the Messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you,' they turn their heads aside and you see them evading while they are arrogant."</p>
      <p>Here, the word knowledge is general even though it relates to worldly matters. For example, an architect's knowledge distinguishes them from a casual laborer. One who possesses skills will have their status elevated, and naturally, their salary will be higher. This is just a worldly matter; consider religious matters. Certainly, an Islamic teacher's position is higher than ordinary people who lack knowledge. Therefore, in society, teachers, and knowledgeable scholars are respected more than ordinary people. That is the privilege of knowledge.</p>
      <p>Thus, the motivation for seeking knowledge is not limited to mere religious practice; rather, it has many virtues. The Prophet also said regarding a person who is devoted to worship but lacks knowledge in his hadith.</p>
      <p>"The excellence of the knowledgeable over the worshiper is like the excellence of the full moon over all the stars." The meaning of this hadith is that no matter how many stars there are, they cannot illuminate the earth like the moon. The moon is singular, but when it is full, it illuminates the entire earth. This is unlike the stars; although there are many, they are not as bright as the full moon. That is the virtue of a knowledgeable person. A knowledgeable person surpasses a worshiper, someone devoted to worship but lacking in knowledge. In another hadith, the Prophet said, "The excellence of a knowledgeable person over a worshiper is like my excellence over the least of you." The Prophet said this in another hadith.      </p>
