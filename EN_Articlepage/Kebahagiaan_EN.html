      <p>Many people seek happiness in various ways. People who commit sins seek happiness in sinning. Some believe that by having a lot of money, they can be happy. So, throughout their lives, their primary focus is on making money.      </p>
      <p>Some seek happiness by drinking or consuming forbidden substances like drugs. Because they feel that by consuming these substances, they can be happy, so throughout their lives, second by second, they drink, consume drugs.      </p>
      <p>Everyone has different views on happiness. Some are fond of women, so they pursue women everywhere. They hunt for women, but we'll edit that later. So, the definition of happiness varies for each individual. And do we know that the happiness most people seek on earth is superficial? For example, there are people with a lot of money who initially thought that having a lot of money would make them happy, but at the end of their lives, they commit suicide. Despite having wealth, they are stressed, and sometimes their families fall apart. What does this show? That seeking happiness with money is not genuine happiness, not true happiness. A scholar said, human happiness shifts. So sometimes we are happy with a lot of money, but after having money, we want our happiness to shift back to a simple life.      </p>
      <p>Likewise, people who seek happiness by dating or having relationships with many women, surely they get bored with one woman, and instead of sticking to her, they move on to another woman. This is superficial happiness.</p>
      <p>True happiness, on the other hand, is the happiness that God bestows because He is our spirit, our one and only God.      </p>
      <P>The one who knows best what true happiness is that a human should possess. In the Quran, Allah says whoever does righteous deeds, believes, and acts righteously, whether male or female, will be given a good life, a happy life. So this verse shows that scholars conclude that these two sentences in Arabic, if translated, true happiness comes from Allah. This is the only way, there is no other way. If people want to seek happiness, look at the free sex workers, look at drug addicts, look at people who are struggling with wealth. How does their life end up? Suffering. Look at Korean artists who might not be pretty enough, not wealthy enough, not successful enough. In the end, they commit suicide. This is the question of people nowadays, what is the essence of happiness? Many people feel they are already happy, but that happiness is not genuine. So look at the scholars. Some of them even get their hands or feet cut off, or even killed, but they are still happy. In such conditions, they still feel happy. Why? Because happiness is already in their hearts. How did Ibn Taymiyyah feel happy when he was imprisoned? Happiness is in his heart. So even if I'm imprisoned for the rest of my life, I bring happiness here. Why in his heart? Because Allah is in his heart. Those are the knowledgeable people, the ones obedient to Allah. That is the true definition of happiness. And this is the reality. As we mentioned earlier, we see in the news that in the end, those who have a lot of money, are beautiful, or feel that they have embraced happiness.      </P>
      <p>In the end, it's all an opportunity. Look at Qarun, look at Moses, look at Pharaoh. Was Moses richer than Pharaoh? Was Moses richer than Qarun or Pharaoh? Clearly, Pharaoh and Pharaoh had power, Qarun had wealth, but in the end, Moses was happier. Because why? It goes back to the formula earlier. Happiness comes from Allah. Therefore, seek the happiness that Allah has mentioned in the Quran, and there is no other way except obedience to Allah, faithfully following Allah's commands through the words of His Messenger.      </p>
