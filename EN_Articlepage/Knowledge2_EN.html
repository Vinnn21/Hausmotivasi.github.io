      <p>There is a saying of Imam Ash-Shafi'i that is very beneficial for life in this world and the hereafter. His words are beneficial for both of these livesâ€”this worldly life and the hereafter. The success of an individual depends on this, whether in this world or in the hereafter. His words were quoted by his student, Al-Muzani, his beloved student, in the book Al-Mughni al-Muhtaj, Volume Two.      </p>
      <p>He said, Imam Ash-Shafi'i, may Allah have mercy on him, said, "Whoever desires worldly life, meaning a happy life in this world, must pursue it through seeking knowledge. And whoever desires the Hereafter as well, must also do so through knowledge. And whoever desires success, happiness in both this world and the Hereafter, must do so through knowledge. Knowledge, according to Imam Ash-Shafi'i, is everything in these two matters, both in this world and in the Hereafter.      </p>
      <p>Kita lihat kehidupan di dunia, pesohor-pesohor, orang-orang kaya, para pembesar di dunia ini, tentulah mereka bukan orang yang bodoh. Artinya mereka menjadi orang yang besar, menjadi orang yang sukses, menjadi orang yang kaya dengan ilmu. Bagaimana dengan orang yang tidak berilmu, maka kita lihat kehidupannya tidak sukses. Pekerjaan mentok-mentok orang yang tidak berilmu sebagai buruh kasar, sebagian kadang ada yang menjadi pengemis, artinya kehormatan dia berbanding lurus dengan ilmunya. Semakin dia tidak berilmu, maka kehidupannya semakin tidak memiliki kebahagiaan. Begitulah ilmu di sisi Imam Asy syafi'i dalam pandangannya di dunia, apalagi terlebih di akhirat juga.</p>      
      <p>Let's look at life in this world; celebrities, wealthy people, the leaders of this world, undoubtedly they are not foolish individuals. It means they become great people, successful people, wealthy people through knowledge. What about those who lack knowledge? We see their lives are not successful. At best, the job of someone without knowledge is manual labor, and sometimes they resort to begging. It means their dignity is directly proportional to their knowledge. The less knowledge they have, the less happiness they have in life. That's how knowledge is viewed by Imam Ash-Shafi'i in this world, especially in the Hereafter as well.      </p>
      <p>Imam Ash-Shafi'i also continued his statement by saying, "Whoever desires happiness in the Hereafter, then it is obligatory for him to have knowledge. And knowledge, as Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, is acquired through learning. Knowledge cannot be obtained like transferring data via Bluetooth. A teacher cannot transfer knowledge through dreams. It's impossible. It must be sought, learned. That's knowledge. So, if someone wants happiness in the Hereafter, then it must be through knowledge. And it's clear in Islam that Islam is a religion that exalts knowledge. How could it not? The initial command, the first revelation, was "Read!" The consequence of reading is that one is required to understand what they read. So, for success in the Hereafter, one needs knowledge.      </p>
      <p>Then, Imam Ash-Shafi'i's third statement. "Whoever desires both?" What does "both" mean here? Happiness in this world and happiness in the Hereafter, then it must also be through knowledge. What does it mean? Why separate them? It means this is the balance of life for a balanced person between their worldly and Hereafter life. So, it must be through knowledge. Look at the scholars, the knowledgeable people, the religious teachers. Surely their status is different from those without knowledge. This is an extraordinary statement by Imam Ash-Shafi'i.      </p>
      <p>One of Imam Ash-Shafi'i statements about knowledge is, "Knowledge is not attained except through six things." One of them is intelligence. Besides intelligence, one also needs a teacher. That's why human intelligence must be utilized. It must not be used for negative things, to deceive others, to prank, or to do foolish things. This is forbidden in Shariah. Therefore, one is required to maximize their intelligence. If they have a strong memory, then it is obligatory for them to memorize the Quran, at least a portion of it. That's Imam Ash-Shafi'i view.  </p>
      <P>And as we know, Imam Ash-Shafi'i was at the top, the number one person of his time. As a great scholar, as a pioneer in the principles of Islamic jurisprudence, his name became known as a figure of a school of thought within the Islamic world. His school of thought, the Shafi'i school of thought, was very famous. Because he authored many works, especially Al-Umm, which is voluminous, then Ar-Risalah, and his other books, which are very beneficial in the Islamic world. And he had many students, like Imam Al-Nawawi, Al-Wafi, Al-Muzani. Why did he have many students? Because he was a figure, a knowledgeable person. How could a foolish person have students? It's impossible. That's how a knowledgeable person is respected. It means Imam Ash-Shafi'i's words are not just words, but he realized them. Besides speaking, he pursued what he said. Whoever wants happiness in this world and the Hereafter, except through knowledge, then he pursued it. That's all. Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.      </P>
