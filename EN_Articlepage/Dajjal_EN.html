      <p>One of the signs of the Day of Judgment is the emergence of Dajjal. Dajjal linguistically means falsehood and deception. It refers to someone who deceives and presents falsehood excessively.</p>
      <p>In a hadith, before the appearance of the great Dajjal, that is, the genuine Dajjal, seventy small Dajjals will emerge. What does a small Dajjal mean? It refers to seventy liars. What does "liar" mean here? They are people who claim to be prophets. Imagine, in Indonesia alone, there are already many, perhaps more than seventy, who have claimed to be prophets. But according to the hadith of the Prophet, before the arrival of the genuine Dajjal, the one with a damaged eye and the word "disbeliever" written on his forehead, these small Dajjals who are skilled at lying, who claim to be prophets, who claim to have miracles, who claim to possess powers like God, will appear first. These are the liars, and the path of the small Dajjals has not yet emerged.      </p>
      <p>Even this genuine Dajjal, these small Dajjals already have many followers. In Indonesia, we see that just one person claiming to be a prophet has hundreds of followers. That's just the small Dajjal. What about the great Dajjal? It is narrated that this Dajjal will be able to produce flour from his hand, bring forth rain, and bring forth gold. He will even transform a village that believes in him into what appears to be paradise, making it prosperous. Then, the village that betrays, that does not acknowledge him as God, will be transformed into a desolate place. That's the trial of Dajjal, as narrated in authentic hadiths.      </p>      
      <p>There was a young man who challenged this Dajjal. Yes, this young man was a believer. He recognized the characteristics of this Dajjal as described in the extensive hadith of the Prophet, which states that this Dajjal will have curly hair, be short in stature, and have reddish skin. And on his forehead, it will be written "Disbeliever." No one will be able to read it except for someone who has faith in his heart, even if it's as small as a mustard seed. This young man knew because he had knowledge about this Dajjal. So, despite whatever miracles Dajjal might perform, even if those miracles could bring happiness to those who follow him, this young man, because of his faith, because of his knowledge, was convinced that this was the Dajjal described by the Prophet as a liar who brings false miracles, which are actually deceptions from Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala, to become a trial for the Muslims. So this young man challenged Dajjal, and then he was split in two. He was split, split into two halves, in one narration using a saw, split from head to groin, then joined back together. This means after being split, this young man died, and then Dajjal joined him back together.</p>      
      <p>Then he was asked again, "Now, after your experience, do you believe in me, do you confess and acknowledge me as God?" This young man reverted because of his faith, because of his knowledge of the hadith of the Prophet, that this was truly the Dajjal who would be a trial for the Muslims. He still said, "You are a liar, you are the Dajjal described by the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, in his hadith." Look at the faith of this young man. In Arabic, a young man means someone under the age of 40, meaning he wasn't old yet, but because he had knowledge and faith, he was like this. We can draw wisdom from this young man.      </p>
      <p>It takes knowledge and faith to resist the waves of the trials of this world. Look at the internet world; we see a lot of negative content, provocative content, pornographic content, content that leads people to blasphemy against Allah. Without faith, a young person will fall into it. But this young man, because of his faith, was able to resist it. We see many people changing their religion for the slightest worldly gain. They're given instant noodles, given a little wealth, and they're willing to change their religion, given an offer. A beautiful woman is willing to apostatize and change her religion. Imagine this poor Dajjal and the people who disbelieve in him.      </p>
      <p>Meaning, this young man who exposed Dajjal was also killed, split, and then joined back together. He was asked again if he still knew that he was a liar, not God. Even if he could bring rain, turn a once fertile village into a barren land, or bring joy to people in this world? Even in one narration, he could revive the dead. But because of his faith, he remained consistent in his belief. And the Prophet promised paradise to this young man, and he died who? And he was the strongest in faith at that time. So then this Dajjal walks. It is narrated that he reaches the White Tower, where he is killed by Prophet Isa, peace be upon him. Prophet Isa approaches him, and then this Dajjal melts like salt</p>
